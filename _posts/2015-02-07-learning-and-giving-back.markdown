When you begin to learn something new, whether it's going into a new career field, a new technology, a new language, inherently there will be roadblocks that keep you from moving forward. These roadblocks are a part of the process. It's expected. How you overcome those roadblocks will determine the effectiveness of your progress. In a lot of cases, having someone there to help guide you over those roadblocks make things a little easier.

When I started school I learned the foundations of the web. I needed more because I'm impatient and addicted to learning. Fortunately, I had a couple of people in my life that were more than willing to push me (and push me in the right direction). Having someone there to help me solve problems and give me resources to help me learn on my own was extremely valuable to my success. The people that helped me didn't get paid for it. They weren't officially recognized teachers. They were people that knew more than I did and wanted to show me the path to success. I am totally grateful for these people.

##It's not what you know, it's HOW you know.

I feel like one of the most important lessons that I have learned over the past few years is that it's not what you know that makes you successful in your education; It's learning how to learn. For example, a front-end developer, typically, won't know EVERYTHING about the [HTML5 stack](http://learningcircuits.blogspot.com/2011/12/what-do-we-mean-when-we-say-html5.html). The most important thing for them to understand is HOW to get the information they need to be a good developer.

When you know everything, but don't understand HOW to learn, there isn't much room for your personal growth.

##Giving Back

Without those people in my life to help guide me in the right direction I don't know where I'd be right now. Sharing their industry knowledge, resources for learning more, and pro-tips helped me more than my formal education did.

It's important to give back to your industry. Help others who are starting out or maybe are trying to learn something else. Even if you don't have all of the answers, you still might know something that they don't, or be able to help them in another way. Being involved in someone else's education can reenforce what you may already know, but it could also allow you to learn something new.

All in all, it's important to give back. If someone is wanting to learn something and they are looking for some help, get involved. Show them what you know and, more importantly, show them how to figure it out for themselves.
