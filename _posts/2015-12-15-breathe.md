It's important to be mindful and to stay centered in times of anxiety. I sometimes struggle with being anxious occasionally, so I made a suuuuper simple graphic to help me relax. Not surprisingly, it's called **Breathe**. For two minutes this rotating, pulsing graphic grows and shrinks prompting you to follow with your breathing. After two minutes it disappears and you should feel more relaxed.
