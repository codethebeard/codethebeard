##Hello World;

FINALLY! I got my blog to a state that I can actually start blogging. I've have had so many different ideas for blog posts and things to talk about but I didn't really have a custom place that can act as a creative outlet. Now I have one.

This year, I have decided to proactively blog. Whether it's about web, food, life, or whatever, I will blog about it. Hopefully someone will read it and it's interesting enough to get through. Hell, if I help someone with what I write about, even better. I think this need to blog and to keep blogging stemmed from a post that I read from a good friend of mine, Josh. He talks about rethinking the process of following through with your [New Years Resolutions][07e306bd]. It really lit a fire under my ass to push harder to get this site done. It's an interesting concept and highly recommend the read.

##Immediate Goals

__Finish School__: I recently re-enrolled back into school to finish out my degree. I'm on track to graduate in 2 months and I'm hoping that everything goes well. At the end of it I will have an AAS in Dynamic Web Development. Which, in some minds, doesn't really matter. Nonetheless, I'm going to finish because I need to finish.

__Learn More__: After I finish school I won't stop with my learning. I'm a learning junkie and I need to continue keeping things fresh. There are a couple of technologies that I want to become more familiar with. I really want to get more into Node.js, Laravel, and Ember.js. Maybe step into mobile app development.

__Get Fit__: I really need to get back into shape. Since I starting working at a desk I haven't found the time or energy to begin working out again. Though, those are all excuses. I need to MAKE time to get fit and MAKE myself have the energy to do it. And, if I make a habit of it, it will be easier.

##It's been a rough month

I debated on whether or not to blog about personal issues and quite honestly, I haven't decided if I'm going to do that. Either way, it's been a rough few weeks and I haven't really had a way to express how I feel about it. It's kind of a complicated situation that I'm sure most people go though at some point in their life. Maybe it's just my turn to go though it. I don't know. It sucks but I'm the kind of person who copes with pain by involving myself in copious amounts of work. It takes my mind off things. I'm not really sure if it's an effective way to deal with issues or if there is any way that I could deal with it differently. It'll work out, I'm sure.

~Happiness is a choice~

So. Blog more, learn more, workout more. That's my immediate plans. What happens past that is just the way life moves me. I'm ok with that.
