I've been really interested in IoT and embedded software ever since I participated in [GE's Mega-Hackathon](/portfolio/hackathon) so I have been working on a couple different projects to get my feet wet again. This time, I pulled in my boss, Mark Shelton to work on this project with me. We were both interested in the technology and to take on a project that would take a little bit of time to develop.

We decided to make a [magic mirror](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/) that would show information that we wanted in realtime. Our goal is to create the software using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and deploying it on a Raspberry Pi in Kiosk Mode, build a 2 way mirror with a monitor behind it to display the information.

This is an ongoing project and we will be updating the code every weekend or so until we get the software complete.
