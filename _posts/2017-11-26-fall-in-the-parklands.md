I love the city. It has convenience, resources, food, and noise. Lots of noise. So, occasionally I have a need to trade the tumult of the busy city in for some serenity in the parks. Most of the time I have a camera.

As a child, I grew up in a small rural town best known as Abraham Lincoln's birthplace. It was a tiny town with three stop lights surrounded by acres and acres of farm land. It was quiet and calm, much like the parks here in Louisville. This park reminds me of the times I'd get lost in corn fields and take in the loveliness of nature.

On this particular day in late November I hiked alone taking moments to just stand and listen to the wind move through the leafless limbs of the trees. It was serene. Moments later, as if they had appeared from thin air, I was greeted by hot air balloons silently creeping in as they landed in the park. The pilot in the blue and black balloon was kind enough to say "hello, down there!" from a hundred feet up as he drifted past. I'd like to fly in one of those some day.
