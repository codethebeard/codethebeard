I live and work in the city and I love it. It has convenience, resources, food, but it has noise. Lots of noise. Occasionally, I have a need to trade in the [sounds of the city](http://codethebeard.com/soundsoflouisville) for some serenity in the parks.

I grew up in a small rural town best known as Abraham Lincoln's birthplace. It was a tiny town with three stop lights surrounded by acres and acres of farm land. It was quiet and calm, much like the parks here in Louisville. This park reminds me of the times I'd get lost in corn fields and take in the loveliness of the nature that surrounded me.

On this particular day in late November I hiked alone, taking small moments to stand and listen to the wind move through the leafless limbs of the trees. It was serene. I particularly enjoyed the Goldenrod waving their heads in the wind as the setting sun shined through them. As I was heading back, I was surprised by hot air balloons silently creeping in as they landed in the park fields. The pilot in the blue and black balloon was kind enough to say "hello, down there!" from a hundred feet up as he drifted past. I'd like to fly in one of those some day.
