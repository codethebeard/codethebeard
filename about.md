# Hello

I'm Michael Large. I am front-end developer and designer based in Louisville, Kentucky and I LOVE the web. 

I work at the coolest place ever, [DBS>Interactive](http://dbswebsite.com/ "The Coolest Place Ever"), a full service digital agency, WITH the coolest people ever.

Breakfast food is becoming one of my favorite things to do lately.
