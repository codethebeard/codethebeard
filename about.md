My name is Michael Large. I'm a front-end developer with a passion for art, technology, and food. You can find me traversing through the tubes of the internets, or plugged into the matrix.

If you are more old-school you can find me on [Twitter][ca21e167], [Github][97e94645], or [CodePen.io][a294be94].

I currently work for an awesome full-service digital agency: [DBS>Interactive][306dc1da] â™¥
