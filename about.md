I'm Michael. I work as a Lead Software Engineer with some pretty fantastic people at Churchill Downs, Inc in Louisville, KY. I love learning new things, challenging myself, and getting my hands dirty. You'll occasionally see me hiking around with a camera, making something, or keeping a bar stool warm at my local breweries.

If you fancy my thoughts or want to troll me on the internet, hit me up on twitter [@codethebeard](https://twitter.com/codethebeard/)
