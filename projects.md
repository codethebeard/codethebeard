Currently working on a BUNCH of projects. Will list them here soon.

##DBS Share Count
[DBS Share Count](https://github.com/DBSInteractive/DBS-Share-Count) is an awesome little OOP-PHP social media count plugin that uses WordPress Transients ( WordPress' caching ) to minimize API requests and reduce load times drastically. I am working on this project with the awesome team at DBS Interactive. Right now, it's built as a simple PHP Class that gets included into your template files. I have plans on turning this into a WordPress Plugin as soon as I get time.

##Rainbowtize

A simple, stupid, and useless bookmarklet that makes website pages more fun. [See It Here!](http://codethebeard.com/rainbowtize)
