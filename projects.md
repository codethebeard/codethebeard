## Sounds Of Louisville

[Sounds Of Louisville](http://soundsoflouisville.com) is an exploration of the different sounds you hear in a city. I was born and raised in a small rural town so the hustle and bustle of the city was something I had to get used to. I love the complexity and unique sounds you get from different parts of Louisville, so I created Sounds Of Louisville to illustrate that point. This project was built in Angular utilizing Google Maps, SoundCloud, and a JSON data store. Visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/codethebeard/soundsoflouisville) to see more.

## Tea Time

I love doing quick, fun, mini-projects over lunch. Tea Time came from my love for asking for blended teas at Heine Bros on 4th Street. Plus, I had some really talented friends become interested in the concept and took on some parts of the project. Shoutout to Emily Clark, Tim Wallis, and Mark Shelton who gladly pitched in to help with some of the components. View [Tea Time](http://codethebeard.com/teatime) on your mobile device.

## FTATB

One of my passions is video production and writing. I get to do both of those at FTATB a web series about the beverage industry and the people that make it tick. [FTATB](http://fuckthatsatastybeverage.com/)

## DBS Share Count

[DBS Share Count](https://github.com/DBSInteractive/DBS-Share-Count) is an awesome little OOP-PHP social media count plugin that uses WordPress Transients ( WordPress' caching ) to minimize API requests and reduce load times drastically. I am working on this project with the awesome team at DBS Interactive. Right now, it's built as a simple PHP Class that gets included into your template files. I have plans on turning this into a WordPress Plugin as soon as I get time.
