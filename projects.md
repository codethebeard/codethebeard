## FTATB

One of my passions is video production and writing. I get to do both of those at FTATB a web series about the beverage industry and the people that make it tick. [FTATB](http://fuckthatsatastybeverage.com/)

## DBS Share Count

[DBS Share Count](https://github.com/DBSInteractive/DBS-Share-Count) is an awesome little OOP-PHP social media count plugin that uses WordPress Transients ( WordPress' caching ) to minimize API requests and reduce load times drastically. I am working on this project with the awesome team at DBS Interactive. Right now, it's built as a simple PHP Class that gets included into your template files. I have plans on turning this into a WordPress Plugin as soon as I get time.

## Stupid Bookmarklets
