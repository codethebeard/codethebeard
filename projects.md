Currently working on a BUNCH of projects. Will list them here soon.

##FTATB

Pardon the name, but if you like the beverage industry you'll understand. A group of my friends and I have started a web series devoted to exposing people to not only the delicious cocktails and drinks across Louisville, but to showcase the amazing people that make them. My role is media production and development. Along with my collegues I produce the concept, organize the creative aspect of the shoots, and edit the video. See more at [FTATB](http://ftatb.com/)

##Rainbowtize

A simple, stupid, and useless bookmarklet that makes website pages more fun. [See It Here!]("http://codethebeard.com/rainbowtize")
